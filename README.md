## What Is ER-99?
ER-99 is a web-based instrument drum machine based on a famous Japanese instrument from the 1980s, and was released on 9/09/2022.

All of the drums are [synthesized using the WebAudio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). The hi-hats, crash, and ride cymbals are produced from sampled audio.

The original  drum machine that inspired this project is an analog sound design masterpiece, and you can read circuit analysis about its clever use of noise and bandpass filters over on [Network 909](http://www.network-909.de/circuit.htm). I've tried to use the same techniques in the digital domain, but I'm sure they can be tweaked to get them to get even closer sounding.
